# Matanza
 Isaiah Sillemon tells the story of how he went to Matanzas during his time in New Mexico how it broke down a barrier of what community really means through the means of food.  


## The Matanza Story
At first glance, my matanza story sounds like a simple memory about trying amazing food in New Mexico for the first time. When I read it back through the lens of the course this semester, it becomes something much deeper, a story about migration, labor, ritual, community belonging, and learning how traditions shape identity. What stands out is how food becomes the pathway through which I cross cultural boundaries and confront differences between what I grew up knowing and what I encounter when I step into another community’s lived traditions.
I started the story by grounding it in where I come from Dallas, Southern cooking, Tex-Mex, and Thanksgiving traditions. This reflects a classic course theme: food as something that anchors identity to place and family memory. My Thanksgiving foods represent not just meals but the emotional geography of home. This is similar to what we studied with national rituals, food becomes naturalized as “tradition,” even when we don’t normally question how these traditions are constructed.
The moment of entering the matanza kind of messes up that familiarity. I treat the tradition with skepticism “we’ll see to believe it” which reveals how cultural distance creates disbelief. The matanza doesn’t fit neatly into my prior understanding of a food tradition. What hits me hardest is that this ritual is built on visible labor. The killing, skinning, and processing of the pig happens communally, with all hands on deck, where all the men, including me and my teammates, take part. In class, we’ve talked about how mainstream food culture hides the realities of slaughter and production. Here, the opposite occurs: food becomes inseparable from labor. This challenges the sanitized way Americans often consume animal products without acknowledging the violence or work behind them.
In this sense, the matanza functions as a counter narrative to industrialized food systems. Instead of distancing eaters from producers, it collapses the categories entirely, those who eat also work. The ritual emphasizes accountability and interdependence. Food is not something purchased; it is something created together. Eating becomes both reward and recognition of shared labor, rather than an isolated consumer act.
The communal nature of the experience is another key theme. My reflection that people from the community came together laughing, eating, and even playing football afterward reveals how ritual meals are about producing belonging as much as producing food. Like Thanksgiving, the matanza performs social unity through shared participation. But unlike national holiday rituals, this unity is immediate and local, not imagined across a nation but lived between people physically present. Rather than symbolically smoothing over differences, the matanza builds solidarity through work and hospitality.

Race and migration also sit just beneath the surface. As a young Black man from Texas newly relocated to New Mexico, I’m not an “insider” to this cultural tradition. Yet I’m welcomed into the labor and the feast, which becomes a moment of earned inclusion rather than superficial multicultural celebration. I’m not consuming a cultural spectacle from the outside; I’m participating materially. This disrupts the idea that cultural exchange is passive or extractive. Instead, it highlights how trust, vulnerability, and contribution grant access to community space.
Even the phrase describing my experience of a “different taste palette” points to identity expansion. Food here is not replacing my own traditions; it is layering onto them. The matanza doesn’t erase Thanksgiving it complicates it. I come away recognizing that traditions aren’t fixed inheritances but evolving relationships built through experiences that connect people across histories and differences.
 This story isn’t about “good food.” It’s about how food becomes a pathway to seeing labor, building solidarity, navigating cultural differences, and reshaping identity. The matanza stands as a powerful reminder that eating is never just about flavor, it is about the social worlds and power structures that bring food into being, and how those worlds invite or exclude people from belonging.
